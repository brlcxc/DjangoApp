  This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a web-based application that combines group budgeting with personalized financial insights through Large Language Model (LLM) technology. With this integration, users gain enhanced capabilities to track, analyze, and manage both individual and collective finances in a streamlined, accessible format.  

  Please note, that hosted website server will take time to spin up after a period of activation due to us using a free service

  ### AI Analytics

  The purpose of the analysis is to take in existing user transaction data along with a financial situation. With this information the LLM will output transactions that are likely to happen along with a budgeting suggestion on those generated transactions. This gives the user an idea of how to possibly proactively change their budgeting habits.

  Scenario Processing: Users can input financial scenarios, such as holiday-related spending. The LLM generates a relevant spending situation and categories for these scenarios, allowing users to edit them as needed. This includes a user feedback section allowing users to improve and fine-tune LLM suggestions, enhancing customization

  ### Calendar
  
  Transactions can be viewed in a calendar format as well. This is especially beneficial for being able to see transactions which might occur on specific days of the month such as a credit card payment every 19th of the month
